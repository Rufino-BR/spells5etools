For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\n<p>Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\n<p>The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\n<p>Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>\n<p>A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>\n<p>Spells and magical effects such as {@spell dispel magic} have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different {@spell antimagic field} spells don't nullify each other.</p>"

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p>You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a {@chance 25|||Capsizes!|No effect} chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p>You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p>This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw.

Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a {@chance 25|||Capsizes!|No effect} chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p>You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain.

Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 2d8} Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\n<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p>\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>"

Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>"

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p>\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB}, you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p>\n<p>The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a {@action Magic|XPHB} action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB} or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>"

The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.</p>\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.</p>\n<p>The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object.

You inscribe the detection glyph either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the detection glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>\n<p>Both glyphs are nearly invisible, and finding either requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<p>You decide what triggers the detection glyph when you cast this spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>\n<p>When you inscribe the detection glyph, choose an alarm glyph or spell glyph to link to it.</p>\n<p>You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. Each of these two glyphs must stay within 100 miles of the other or the spell effect ends. When the detection glyph is triggered, the effect glyph reacts like an alarm spell, creating a mental ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the effect glyph. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p>\n<p>You create and magically link two glyphs: a detection glyph and an effect glyph. These two glyphs must be within 100 feet of each other. You can store a prepared spell of 4th level or lower in the effect glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyphs. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the detection glyph is triggered, the spell stored in the effect glyph is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on the effect glyph. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the effect glyph. If the spell requires {@status concentration}, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>"

Your {@variantrule Hit Points|XPHB}, {@variantrule Hit Point Dice|XPHB}, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, {@variantrule Speed|XPHB}, and senses are replaced by the creature's. You otherwise keep your game statistics.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move and it is {@condition Incapacitated|XPHB}.</p>\n<p>While possessing a body, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.</p>\n<p>If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.</p>\n<p>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.</p>"

If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.</p>"

The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.</p>\n<p>The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.</p>\n<p>The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from the {@dice d20} roll.</p>\n<p>In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.</p>\n<p>Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).</p>\n<p>The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by {@spell dispel magic}, and {@spell antimagic field} has no effect on it. A {@spell disintegrate} spell destroys the temple instantly.</p>\n<p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p>"

A {@condition restrained} creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a {@dc 20} Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>"

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li>\n<li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the {@spell greater restoration} spell.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.</li>\n<li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a {@creature lich}'s life drain attack.</li>\n<li>You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a {@spell wish} spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.</p>\n<p>The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days.
